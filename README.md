# found
A terminal utility used to check if a file or directory exists.



Installation:
Clone repo, enter directory and type "make install". Root privileges will be needed to install as a command.

Usage: found [directory or file]

Note: if you would like to try without root privileges or without installing, go to directory and type:
'./found.sh [file or directory]'.
